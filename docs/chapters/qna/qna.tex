You can open them with a \ttt{text editor}.

\begin{tips}{Use a moderen text editor.}
    Some files may have a large number of lines, so it's highly recommended to use a \ttt{modern} text editor, which can highlight symbols and reveal the structure of the file, such as:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Visual Studio Code
        \item \href{https://vscode.dev/}{Visual Studio Code - Web Online}
        \item Vim
        \item Emacs
        \item Sublime Text
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tips}

\section{How to update fuji to a new version?}

\subsection{Step 1. Backup the data}
You should back up the \ttt{config/fuji} directory.

\subsection{Step 2. Test the new version in your test-environment}
Put the new version of fuji into \ttt{mods/} directory, start the server, and adjust the configuration to what you want.

\begin{warn}{Don't test new changes directly in your production-environment}
    It's highly recommended to setup a test-environment for a network-maintainer, so that you can test and tweak installed mods into what you want, and avoid un-expected situations.
\end{warn}

\subsection{Step 3. Apply the changes to production-environment}
Now, it's ready to apply the changes to your production-environment.
